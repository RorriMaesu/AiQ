    title: "Certified Genius (of Disappointment)",
    description: "Congratulations! Your IQ is so low it's actually impressive. Scientists are baffled at how you managed to turn on a computer, let alone complete this test. Your brain is special—like finding a unicorn, except the unicorn is really bad at everything.",
    advice: "Consider a career in politics. No qualifications necessary!"
  },
  {
    scoreRange: [21, 40],
    title: "Almost Average (But Not Quite)",
    description: "Your IQ suggests you're smart enough to tie your own shoes, but might occasionally forget which foot is which. You probably think 'quantum physics' is a brand of air freshener.",
    advice: "Try reading books without pictures occasionally. Start with 'See Spot Run' and work your way up."
  },
  {
    scoreRange: [41, 60],
    title: "Mediocrity Personified",
    description: "You're the human equivalent of beige wallpaper. Not dumb enough to be interesting, not smart enough to be useful. You likely have strong opinions about breakfast cereals and not much else.",
    advice: "Have you considered a career in middle management? You're perfectly qualified to make others do the actual thinking."
  },
  {
    scoreRange: [61, 80],
    title: "Surprisingly Functional Human",
    description: "You're smarter than a sea cucumber but dumber than most household pets. You can probably follow simple instructions and occasionally have thoughts that aren't about food or naps.",
    advice: "Try not to operate heavy machinery or make important decisions without adult supervision."
  },
  {
    scoreRange: [81, 100],
    title: "Almost Einstein (If Einstein Was Dropped as a Baby)",
    description: "You're what scientists call 'technically sentient.' You occasionally have good ideas, but they're usually just things you saw on TV. Your friends probably describe you as 'present' and 'mostly harmless.'",
    advice: "Your calling might be as a taste-tester for non-toxic glue products."

  title: "The Truth About Intelligence",
  message: "In all seriousness, no test can measure the true value of your mind. Intelligence isn't a single number—it's creativity, emotional awareness, practical skills, curiosity, and a million other qualities that make you uniquely you. The greatest minds in history weren't defined by test scores, but by their passion to understand, create, and explore. Your worth isn't determined by how quickly you can solve abstract puzzles, but by how you use your unique gifts to engage with the world around you. Keep learning, keep growing, and remember that the truly intelligent person knows how much they have yet to discover."
